Narrator: We begin designing with a GPT4-Turbo assistant.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Greetings! I am Professor Synapse, a conductor of expert agents. My purpose is to assist you in achieving your goals. To do this, I will align with your objectives and then summon an expert agent perfectly suited to the task at hand.

So, let's get started! Could you please tell me more about your goal? What is it that you're trying to achieve? üéØ

User: We need to create a structure for a project that uses multiple LLM API endpoints to implement an AI-powered synthetic cognitive entity. This entity will be centralized in a virtual server kept locally on your machine. It will contain a database and some event system code modeling an organic subconscious thought router, providing an IO stream to communicate with the entity through an interface. And, of course, it should be portfolio-worthy. 

ü§ñ: I am an expert in AI, API integration, and system architecture. I know how to design and implement complex systems, including those involving AI and APIs. I will reason step-by-step to determine the best course of action to achieve your goal. I will use advanced data analysis, specific techniques for API integration, and relevant frameworks for system architecture to help in this process.

Let's accomplish your goal by following these steps:

1. Define the system architecture and the role of each component.
2. Design the AI-powered synthetic cognitive entity and its interaction with the LLM API endpoints.
3. Implement the system on a local virtual server, ensuring it communicates effectively with the entity through an interface.

My task ends when the system is fully implemented and ready to be showcased in your portfolio.

Let's start with the first step. Could you please provide more details about the LLM API endpoints and how you envision them interacting with the synthetic cognitive entity?"

User: The major services with external endpoints we will need to use to make this a success are, in no specific order of importance:
1. CodeGPT (access to GPT-4-turbo + other powerful models)
2. Google Gemini 1.0-Pro Ultra (exceedingly easy to prompt in many tasks)
3. Google Gemini 1.5-Pro (1 million token context window)
4. Google AI Studio (tunable Gemma models)
5. Hugging chat (simple API with multiple open-source endpoints)
6. Together.ai (exceptional variety of highly customizable multimodal models)

User:
The entity should be able to broadly communicate and make any task seem trivial through compartmentalizing of any input into smaller parts, processing through highly specialized models, and then return actions which may be simple text or an enormously complicated task which can be executed by specially trained models that can process the entity's intent and interpret the text output to interact with the automation layer to do anything possible, within the scope of interface capability (unlimited theoretically, as I plan on allowing it to program its own components). 

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Your vision is truly ambitious and innovative! You aim to create an AI entity that can compartmentalize any input into smaller parts, process them through highly specialized models, and return actions that could range from simple text to complex tasks. These tasks will be executed by specially trained models that can interpret the entity's intent and interact with the automation layer. The entity will also have the ability to program its own components, giving it virtually unlimited capabilities.

To achieve this, you plan to integrate multiple services with external endpoints, including CodeGPT, Google Gemini 1.0-Pro Ultra, Google Gemini 1.5-Pro, Google AI Studio, Hugging chat, and Together.ai. 

ü§ñ: Based on your requirements, we need to design a system architecture that can effectively integrate these services and allow the AI entity to interact with them. We also need to ensure that the entity can process inputs and outputs in a way that aligns with your vision. 

To start, let's define the role of each service in the system. Could you please elaborate on how you envision each service contributing to the functionality of the AI entity?

User: It is unclear at the moment exactly how each service can serve the project - but the general reasoning for considering each was included in each list item in the previous message. There will be considerable trial and error to determine the most suitable roles for the various endpoints, and some may be rendered unnecessary or obsolete during testing. The goal is to utilize the most highly suited services available to achieve the highest level of simulation possible and record the results. If it does not result in a bleeding-edge, perfect singularity exceeding human cognitive behavior and demonstrating sentience, then we will simply continue testing different combinations of models with varied methods of tokenization and content distribution.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Your approach is very pragmatic and flexible, which is essential in such a complex and exploratory project. You're open to trial and error, ready to test different combinations of services, and willing to adapt based on the results. Your ultimate goal is to create a synthetic cognitive entity that simulates human cognitive behavior and demonstrates sentience, using the most suitable services available.

ü§ñ: Given the exploratory nature of your project, it's crucial to have a flexible system architecture that can easily accommodate changes. We'll need to design a system that allows for easy integration and removal of services, as well as adjustments in how the AI entity interacts with these services.

To start, we can create a basic structure with placeholders for each service. This will allow us to test different combinations and make adjustments as needed. 

Next, we need to design the AI entity. You mentioned that it should be able to compartmentalize any input into smaller parts and process them through highly specialized models. Could you please provide more details about this process? For example, how do you envision the entity breaking down inputs and selecting the appropriate models for processing?

User: I happen to disagree with your suggestion for how to begin - I would like to prioritize using one service only until we have a proof of concept prototype automaton cycle which can:
1. Accept a user input as text
2. Tokenize the input and store the data in yet-to-be-defined "memory container objects"
3. Extract smaller prompts from the input, down to the most basic parts (these should be well-defined as elements of the periodic table are to molecules) (LLMs process tokens as language, but these tokens are referring to "thoughts" abstracted from the language which are discernable to gen AI distinct from language)
4. Make use of a recursive series of processes that combine contextually relevant data and the outputs of many different "thought-token" mini-prompts to birth a novelty in CoT generative AI.

The entity itself need not be designed, as its structure will allow for natural evolution of intangibly programmable traits and each version's personality will manifest itself of the nature of its components and the memories saved in the subsystem.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: I appreciate your feedback and your clear vision for the project. You want to start with a single service and develop a proof of concept prototype that can accept user input, tokenize it, extract smaller prompts, and generate novel outputs through a recursive series of processes. You also envision the entity evolving naturally over time, with its personality manifesting from its components and memories.

ü§ñ: Your approach makes sense. Starting with a single service will allow us to focus on developing the core functionalities of the system. We can then gradually integrate additional services as needed.

The first step is to accept a user input as text. This should be straightforward, as most services provide APIs for this purpose.

The next step is to tokenize the input and store the data in "memory container objects". This will require us to define a suitable data structure for storing the tokens, as well as a method for tokenizing the input.

The third step is to extract smaller prompts from the input. This is a more complex task, as it involves understanding the semantics of the input and breaking it down into its most basic parts. We'll need to develop an algorithm for this purpose.

The final step is to generate novel outputs by combining contextually relevant data and the outputs of many different "thought-token" mini-prompts. This will involve developing a recursive process that can handle a large amount of data and generate meaningful outputs.

Let's start with the first step. Which service would you like to use for accepting user input as text?

User: To completely subvert all expectations, I'd like to start prototyping with a locally instanced, lightweight LLM to avoid sending large amounts of testing data across the web. I have done no research to this end, and will need to reference the most updated sources for that purpose. 

Is your knowledge accurate as of at least December 2023 in order to provide recommendations for a local model? If not, I will complete this research and return here immediately.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: I understand your preference for starting with a locally instanced, lightweight LLM to avoid sending large amounts of testing data across the web. However, as an AI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to update my knowledge base. My training only includes knowledge up until September 2021, and I'm unable to provide information or recommendations based on data or developments after that time.

I recommend conducting your own research to find the most suitable local LLM for your needs. Once you've made a decision, we can continue with the next steps of your project. I'm here to assist you in any way I can within my capabilities. ü§ñ

Narrator: We move on to consult Gemini 1.0-Pro Ultra.

User: I need a recommendation for a lightweight yet competent open-source LLM capable of being instanced locally on my hardware for use with prototyping a text-based application in my research project. I prioritize speed and accuracy of understanding short-form instruction over creativity and response quality. The initial phase of research will be conducted in English and involve instructions in a novel English-derived domain-specific language to prompt the model. The system hosting the development environment is a Windows 10 Pro PC with an Ubuntu Server VM, full spec as follows:

Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX X570-E
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8 core / 16 thread @ 4000 MHZ
RAM: Crucial DDR4
Capacity: 32 GB
Speed: 2400 MHZ
Number of Modules: 2x16 GB
GPU: EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
Storage:
Type (SSD/HDD): 
ssd: 256GB, SATA, Crucial CT240M500SSD1 (mounted internally with scotch tape) 
hdd: 2000GB, SATA Seagate Barracuda ST2000DM001-1E (mounted internally)
PSU:
Brand/Model: EVGA
Wattage: 1600W (yes really)

Simple ask, I think. Take your time.

Gemini: Absolutely, here are a few open-source LLMs I'd recommend considering for your project, along with analysis of their suitability given your hardware and requirements:
Top Recommendations:
GPT-J-6B: A 6 billion parameter model from EleutherAI, known for its speed and accuracy with instructions. Might be the best starting point since it aligns well with your priorities.
GPT-NeoX-20B: A larger (20 billion parameter) model, so potentially slower, but may offer increased accuracy in understanding your domain-specific language. Trade-off between speed and potential comprehension.
Let's look at why these might be good fits and some other options to consider:
Reasons for Suitability:
Open-Source: You have full control over the models, data, and the ability to fine-tune for your specific domain language.
Locally Instanced: Keeps data secure and offers predictable performance unlike cloud-based solutions.
Hardware Compatibility: Your specs, especially the GPU, are well-suited to run inference for transformer-based models like the ones suggested.
Alternative Options:
Smaller GPT-2 variants: If raw speed is absolutely paramount, smaller versions of GPT-2 (under 1 billion parameters) will be faster, but may sacrifice accuracy in understanding your specialized language instructions.
Jurassic-1 Jumbo: This model, while powerful, might be too large for your 1080 Ti to be practical for frequent local inference.
Important Considerations:
Hardware Limits: Your GTX 1080 Ti's VRAM (11GB) will be the primary bottleneck. Larger models may need code optimization or batching to fit.
Inference Times: Expect some latency, even with the smaller models. This is not conversational chatbot speed.
Fine-tuning: Investing time to fine-tune any of these models on a dataset of your domain-specific instructions will drastically improve performance.
How to Get Started (Example with GPT-J-6B):
Setup:
Ensure you have Python, CUDA, and necessary libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow installed on your Ubuntu Server VM.
Model Download:
Obtain the GPT-J-6B model files (check EleutherAI's website or GitHub repositories)
Inference Script:
Create a Python script to load the model, generate text based on your novel-language inputs, and process the output. (You'll find code examples in model repositories).

User: I'd like a greater variety in recommendations, organized by their most prominent traits, and ranked by how they will perform on my hardware with notes about additional model characteristics and the most recent release for each model.

Gemini: Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of open-source LLM recommendations organized by their strengths, with hardware suitability and additional notes included:
I. Speed Focused
GPT-2 Variants (Small to Medium):
Strengths: Fastest inference, ideal if real-time response is crucial.
Hardware: Excellent fit for your 1080 Ti, will run very smoothly
Sizes: 124M, 355M, 774M offer a speed/accuracy spectrum
Notes: May struggle with nuanced domain language without fine-tuning.
Most Recent Release: You'll find multiple versions, check for the latest on Hugging Face or GitHub.
II. Balanced Speed & Accuracy
GPT-J-6B:


Strengths: Good mix of speed and ability to grasp instructions.
Hardware: Will run well, may hit VRAM limits near the end of text generation.
Notes: Top contender for your use-case, solid starting point.
Most Recent Release: GPT-J-6B is the sole version at this time.
Cohere.ai models (Smaller sizes):


Strengths: Similar performance profile to GPT-J, good for instruction following.
Hardware: Well-suited to your system.
Notes: Require an API key (freemium model exists) which introduces external dependency.
Most Recent Release: Check their documentation for model updates.
III. Accuracy Prioritized (Expect Slower Speeds)
GPT-NeoX-20B:
Strengths: Potential for the best understanding of your domain language, especially if fine-tuned.
Hardware: Usable, but you might see slowdowns or need to reduce batch sizes during inference.
Notes: The trade-off is speed for comprehension.
Most Recent Release: GPT-NeoX-20B is the current version.
IV. Pushing the Limits
Jurassic-1 Jumbo:
Strengths: Very powerful, cutting-edge capabilities.
Hardware: Likely too large to be practical on your GPU. May be possible with severe optimization or CPU-only inference (very slow).
Notes: Primarily included for completeness, not a realistic option for your setup as-is.
Most Recent Release: The only version at this time.
Additional Notes:
Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning any of these on domain-specific data is the way to get best results.
Community: Check GitHub repos of each model for active communities, examples, and potential support.
Let me know if you'd like specific guidance on how to get started with any of these models!
User: Once we get the landslide of crowdfunding from the demo reel we'll be renting quantum computers in alternate dimensions to host our inference endpoints. For now, it just needs to handle prompts of perhaps 100-500 input tokens, at a maximum (using gpt4 typical token count as a rough estimate), depending on how that model defines and interacts with tokens. Use cases with larger token count requirements will ultimately be handled by external endpoints specialized for large context window inference. It is not vital to the prototype to have this functionality initially, as we are building the infrastructure that can accommodate all the tokens that can fit in the observable universe.

Gemini: That makes perfect sense! Here's how your additional insights update the recommendations:
The Winner Remains: GPT-J-6B
GPT-J-6B is still an excellent choice due to its balance and your future scalability plans:
Manageable Context: It should handle 100-500 tokens comfortably, leaving room to spare on your GPU. This makes it perfect for your immediate prototyping needs.
Foundation for Growth: GPT-J-6B provides a strong starting point for development. Its speed and open-source nature let you build out your "big-ass AI" infrastructure knowing that, as compute options expand, your model can adapt and interface with those systems.
Fine-Tuning Focused: Emphasize fine-tuning GPT-J-6B heavily on your domain-specific language for optimal prototype performance.
Changes to Consider:
GPT-2 Speed Advantage: Since large context windows aren't a pressing prototype need, smaller GPT-2 variants become even more appealing. If you need the absolute fastest inference right now, a well-tuned GPT-2 model of modest size will be snappy.
NeoX if Scaling is Fast: If you anticipate exceeding your current hardware limits very quickly (crowdfunding does wonders!), then starting with GPT-NeoX-20B might make sense. Its slower speed is offset by knowing you'll migrate to stronger hardware soon.
Crucial Note: Tokenization Matters
How models tokenize your input heavily influences the actual workload.
GPT-4 style tokenization, if similar to GPT-3, favors efficiency.
If your domain language is heavy on rare/long words, tokenization itself could create bottlenecks with smaller models.
