# Overview

*The full project can be completed by following one of these high-level action plans*

## Version 1

1. Develop a proof of concept prototype for an AI entity that accepts and tokenizes user input, extracts prompts, and generates novel outputs. (High Priority)
2. Define and implement a data structure for "memory container objects" to store tokenized data. (Essential)
3. Create an algorithm to break down inputs into their most basic parts for processing. (Critical)
4. Design a recursive process for the AI to combine data and mini-prompts for novel output generation. (Key Step)
5. Ensure the AI entity can evolve naturally, with personality traits emerging from its components and memories. (Long-term Goal)
6. Start prototyping with a locally instanced, lightweight LLM to maintain data privacy and speed. (Immediate Action)
7. Research and select the most updated local LLM suitable for the project's needs. (Urgent)
8. Design a flexible system architecture that allows for easy integration and removal of services. (Strategic)
9. Integrate multiple services with external endpoints, such as CodeGPT and Google Gemini, for specialized processing. (Integration Task)
10. Enable the AI entity to compartmentalize inputs, process through specialized models, and execute complex tasks. (Core Functionality)
11. Allow the AI entity to program its own components, theoretically granting unlimited interface capabilities. (Innovative Feature)
